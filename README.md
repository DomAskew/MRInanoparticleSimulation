# MRI Nanoparticle Simulation
Nanoparticles as the origin of contrast in magnetic resonance imaging - Project

Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are used in medical applications of magnetic resonance imaging to artificially create a contrast. The increased contrast of an image produced in an MRI procedure results in an improved resolution thus a better diagnosis can be done. In this research report, we will focus on the physics underpinning the contrast produced from a nanoparticle in an external magnetic field by writing a program which can simulate the signal decay of hydrogen ions and finding the corresponding T_2 relaxation times. We will also be analysing how T_2 varies upon variations to the nanoparticles magnetic moment, and its concentration. From our simulation, we found that an increase in magnetic moment, lead to a decrease in T_2. We also found that an increase in nanoparticle concentration, lead to a decrease in T_2.

The bulk of this project is to use knowledge of physics to simulate a nanoparticle diffusing inside the body. We proposed the use of a random walk (Monte carlo) to define the walk of the particle, and from this, implemented diffusion gradients and an external magnetic field to realise the decay of magnetisation over a pulse echo sequence.

Attached is the project writeup.
